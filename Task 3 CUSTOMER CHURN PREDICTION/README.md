# Customer Churn Prediction: 

### Project Overview:

This project focuses on predicting customer churn for a telecommunications company. Customer churn, also known as customer attrition, is a critical issue for businesses as acquiring new customers is often more expensive than retaining existing ones. By accurately predicting which customers are likely to churn, companies can proactively intervene with targeted retention strategies.

This repository contains the code and resources for building and evaluating machine learning models to predict customer churn based on various customer attributes and service usage patterns.

### Problem Statement:


The goal is to develop a predictive model that can identify customers at high risk of churning. This will enable the company to implement effective retention campaigns, reduce customer attrition, and ultimately improve customer lifetime value.

### Dataset:

The dataset used for this project is sourced from a telecommunications company and contains information about various customer attributes, including:

Demographic Information: Gender, Senior Citizen status, Partner, Dependents.

Account Information: Tenure (months customer has stayed with the company), Phone Service, Multiple Lines, Internet Service, Online Security, Online Backup, Device Protection, Tech Support, Streaming TV, Streaming Movies, Contract type, Paperless Billing, Payment Method, Monthly Charges, Total Charges.

Churn: Whether the customer churned or not (target variable).

The dataset is typically in CSV format and includes both numerical and categorical features.

### Features:

###### Data Preprocessing: Handling missing values, encoding categorical features (One-Hot Encoding, Label Encoding), feature scaling (StandardScaler).

###### Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Visualizations to understand data distribution, relationships between features, and churn patterns.

###### Feature Engineering: Creating new features from existing ones to improve model performance.

###### Model Training: Implementation of various machine learning models for classification, such as:

###### Logistic Regression

###### Decision Tree Classifier

###### Random Forest Classifier

###### Gradient Boosting Classifier (e.g., XGBoost, LightGBM)

###### Support Vector Machine (SVM)

### Model Evaluation: 
Using appropriate metrics for imbalanced datasets, such as:

###### Accuracy

###### Precision

###### Recall

###### F1-Score

###### ROC AUC Curve

###### Confusion Matrix

###### Hyperparameter Tuning: Optimizing model parameters for better performance.


### Methodology: 


#### Data Loading and Initial Exploration: 
Load the dataset and perform initial checks for data types, missing values, and basic statistics.

#### Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): 
Visualize distributions of features, analyze churn rates across different categories, and identify potential correlations.

#### Data Preprocessing: 


Handle missing values (e.g., imputation or removal).

Convert categorical features into numerical representations.

Scale numerical features to ensure all features contribute equally to the model.

Feature Selection/Engineering: Select relevant features and potentially create new ones to enhance predictive power.

#### Model Selection and Training:


Split the data into training and testing sets.

Train multiple classification models.

#### Model Evaluation:


Evaluate models using appropriate metrics.

Compare model performances to select the best-performing one.

Hyperparameter Tuning (Optional but Recommended): Fine-tune the best model's hyperparameters using techniques like Grid Search or Random Search.

Prediction and Interpretation: Use the final model to make predictions and interpret the insights gained from the model.



### Prerequisites: 

Python 3.x

Jupyter Notebook (or Jupyter Lab)

### Installation:


#### Clone this repository to your local machine:

git clone https://github.com/Sumit-2104/CodSoft.git

#### Navigate to the project directory:


cd CodSoft/Task\ 3\ CUSTOMER\ CHURN\ PREDICTION/

Install the required Python libraries. It's recommended to use a virtual environment:

Create a virtual environment
python -m venv venv
Activate the virtual environment
On Windows:
venv\Scripts\activate
On macOS/Linux:
source venv/bin/activate
Install dependencies
pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn matplotlib seaborn xgboost lightgbm

### Running the Notebook:

Start a Jupyter Notebook server:

### jupyter notebook:


In the Jupyter interface, navigate to Task 3 CUSTOMER CHURN PREDICTION and open the CUSTOMER CHURN PREDICTION.ipynb notebook.

Run all cells in the notebook to execute the entire analysis and model training pipeline.

### Results:

The notebook will display the performance metrics of various models, including accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and ROC AUC. It will also show confusion matrices and potentially feature importance plots, providing insights into which factors are most influential in predicting churn.
